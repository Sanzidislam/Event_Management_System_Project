### üîß Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Sanzidislam/Event_Management_System_Project.git](https://github.com/Sanzidislam/Event_Management_System_Project.git)
    cd Event_Management_System_Project
    ```

2.  **Set up the Database**
    * Start your SQL database server.
    * Create a new database for the project (e.g., `event_db`).
    * Import the database schema provided in the `SQL/` folder into your newly created database. This will create all the necessary tables.

3.  **Configure the Backend**
    * Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```sh
        cd backend
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. This file will store your sensitive credentials. Add the following configuration, replacing the placeholder values with your actual database credentials:
        ```env
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_USER=your_db_username
        DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
        DB_NAME=event_db
        PORT=5001
        ```
    * Install the required npm packages:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```

4.  **Configure the Frontend**
    * Navigate to the frontend directory from the root project folder:
        ```sh
        cd frontend
        ```
    * Install the required npm packages:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

To run the application, you need to start both the backend and frontend servers.

1.  **Start the Backend Server**
    * In the `backend` directory, run:
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```
    * The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5001` (or the port you specified in your `.env` file).

2.  **Start the Frontend Application**
    * In a separate terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```
    * The React development server will start, and the application will automatically open in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

You can now interact with the Event Management System in your browser! üéâ
